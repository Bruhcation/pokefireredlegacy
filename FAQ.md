Q: How are the Trade Evos Handled

A: Trade evos like Golem and Gengar evolve by lvl, you should be able to get the evos by koga's level cap.
For Item trade evos like Kingdra, they evolve when you give them their trade evo item.

Those items could be found on the two island store but mostly held by wild pokemon (Slowpoke, Poliwhirl: King's Rock) (Horsea: Dragon Scale) (Onix: Metal Coat) (Oddish: Sun Stone) (Upgrade: Game Corner)
Some of the items are found in item balls but you should explore
